  Real-time collaborative editors are common tools to distribute work across
  space, time, and organizations. Unfortunately, current mainstream editors such
  as Google Docs rely on central servers which raises privacy and scalabitity
  issues.  \CRATE is a real-time decentralized collaborative editor that runs
  directly in web browsers. It uses distributed data structures and
  browser-to-browser communication. \TODO{Compared to google docs\ldots} This
  demo paper describes its functionning and proposes a live experiment where
  people would write a document together sharing a common goal.
