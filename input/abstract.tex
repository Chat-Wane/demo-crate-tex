  Real-time collaborative editors are common tools to distribute work across
  space, time, and organizations. Unfortunately, current mainstream editors such
  as Google Docs rely on central servers which raises privacy and scalabitity
  issues. Decentralized solutions alleviates privacy issues at the price of the
  ease-of-usage brought by the Cloud. \CRATE is a real-time decentralized
  collaborative editor that runs directly in modern web browsers. It uses
  distributed data structures and browser-to-browser communication. This demo
  paper describes its functionning and proposes a live experiment where people
  would write a document together sharing a common goal.
