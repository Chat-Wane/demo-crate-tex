\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we described \CRATE, a distributed and decentralized real-time
collaborative editor running in web browsers. Compared to state-of-the-art,
\CRATE allows real-time editing anytime, anywhere, whatever the number of
participants. It can be seen as an alternative way to provide a collaborative
editing service without Cloud support. Using a scalable replicated data
structure for sequences, and an adaptive peer sampling protocol, \CRATE is able
to alleviate scalability issues and privacy issues without compromising
ease-of-access. \CRATE's video, source code and online demo are available at
