\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we described \CRATE, a distributed and decentralized real-time
collaborative editor running in web browsers. Using a scalable replicated data
structure for sequences, and an adaptive peer sampling protocol, \CRATE is able
to alleviate scalability issues while solving privacy issues without
compromising ease-of-access. We proposed to perform a live experiment where
WWW2016 participants would be invited to write a document sharing a same
goal. We hope to obtain a meaningful document along with precious measurements
both on performance and opinion about the editor.
