\section{Usage}

\CRATE is a real-time collaborative editor running in web browsers. As a web
application, it is hosted on a web server at
\emph{\url{http://chat-wane.github.io/CRATE/}}. Hence, users simply navigate to
the web page with their web browser\footnote{A small restriction being that it
  must support WebRTC.}.

A user creates a document. At the time, the document is only local and no one
can read or modify it apart from its creator. When the user is ready to share
its content with collaborators of his, he simply copy--pastes a uniform resource
locator (URL) to them. Once the collaborators open the link, it automatically
connects them to the editing session of the creator. It retrieves the shared
document and they can start the real-time collaborative editing.
