Real-time collaborative editors allow authors to simultaneously write a shared
document. While being undoubtedly useful most of current tools available belong
to the Cloud. With centralization come privacy and scalability issues. To
reconcile with the Internet working distributed without central authorities,
editors start to get rid of such centrality point, which in turns solves privacy
issues. Still scalability problem remains, and usability formerly provided by
the Cloud is gone.

\CRATE is a distributed and decentralized \textsc{c}ollabo\textsc{rat}ive
\textsc{e}ditor providing scalable real-time editing capabilities directly
within modern web browsers.
