\CRATE is based on the optimistic replication scheme. Thus, each editor
replicates the document locally and directly performs operations on it. Next,
changes are spread to all other participants. The system is correct iff editors
integrating a same set of changes have replicas converging to an equivalent
state, i.e., users read the same document.  This property is called strong
eventual consistency~\cite{shapiro2011comprehensive}.

\CRATE uses a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) for sequences to ensure
such property~\cite{shapiro2011comprehensive}. CRDTs ensure consistency at the
price of a unique identifier attached to each element of the sequence. Recently,
\LSEQ~\cite{nedelec2013lseq} proposed a strategy to bound the space complexity
of these identifiers to $\mathcal{O}(\log(d)^2)$ where $d$ is the document
size. This result avoids to run costly distributed garbage-collection-like
mechanisms to maintain the efficiency of the editor.

Eventual consistency requires that all operations are received by all editing
session members.  \CRATE builds an editing session using
\SPRAY~\cite{nedelec2015spray}, a random peer sampling
protocol~\cite{jelasity2007gossip} (RPS) built on top of WebRTC. A peer sampling
protocol provides each network member with a partial view of the network
significantly smaller compared to this latter. Maintaining randomness among
partial views ensures the connectivity of the network. Unlike prior RPS, \SPRAY
allows adapting the partial view sizes to the editing session size without
measuring its number of participants. Since the propagation protocol of messages
extensively uses these tables, the network traffic inherits this scalability.
\CRATE adapts its operation to the needs of the editing session.

The distributed and decentralized \textsc{c}ollabo\textsc{rat}ive
\textsc{e}ditor \CRATE is developed in web languages only: HTML, CSS, and mostly
JavaScript. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}, \CRATE comprises four
layers:
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [\textbf{The graphical user interface}] that renders the document to the users
  (cf. Figure~\ref{img:screenshot}). Each local update is immediately applied to
  the document view for real-time sake. Then, the update is applied to the
  replicated data type;
\item [\textbf{The sequence structure layer}] that represents the local document
  (cf. ยง\ref{sec:structure}). It is in charge of providing the metadata
  necessary to order each character identically anywhere;
\item [\textbf{The causality layer}] that tracks semantic causality between operations,
  e.g., the removal of a character cannot precede its insertion;
\item [\textbf{The network layer}] that
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item builds a network of browsers for each editing session and
  \item uses it to propagate the updates to all collaborators
    (cf. ยง\ref{sec:network}).
  \end{inparaenum}
\end{asparadesc}
