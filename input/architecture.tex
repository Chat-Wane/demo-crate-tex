The distributed and decentralized \textsc{c}ollabo\textsc{rat}ive
\textsc{e}ditor \CRATE\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Chat-Wane/CRATE}}
developed in web languages only: html, css, JavaScript. It comprises four
layers:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item the graphical user interface that renders the document to the users
  (cf. Figure~\ref{img:screenshot});
\item the sequence structure layer that represents the local replica of the
  document (cf. ยง\ref{sec:structure});
\item the causality layer that tracks semantic causality between operations,
  e.g., the removal of a character cannot precede its insertion.
\item the network layer that both builds a network of browsers and use it to
  disseminate the operations performed on documents (cf. ยง\ref{sec:network});
\end{inparaenum}
