\label{sec:architecture}

The distributed and decentralized \textsc{c}ollabo\textsc{rat}ive
\textsc{e}ditor \CRATE developed in web languages only: HTML, CSS, and mostly
JavaScript. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}, \CRATE comprises four
layers:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item [\textbf{the graphical user interface}] that renders the document to the users
  (cf. Figure~\ref{img:screenshot}). Each local update is immediatly applied to
  the document view for real-time sake. Then, the update is applied to the
  replicated data type;
\item [\textbf{the replicated data type layer}] that represents the local document
  (cf. ยง\ref{sec:structure}). It is in charge of providing the metadata
  necessary to order each character identically anywhere;
\item [\textbf{the causality layer}] that tracks semantic causality between operations,
  e.g., the removal of a character cannot precede its insertion;
\item [\textbf{the network layer}] that
  \begin{inparaenum}
  \item builds a network of browsers for each editing session and
  \item uses it to propagate the updates to all collaborators
    (cf. ยง\ref{sec:network}).
  \end{inparaenum}
\end{enumerate}
