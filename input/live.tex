In laboratory, we tested \CRATE on the Grid'5000 testbed with configurations
involving up till 600 browsers. Figure~\ref{fig:traffic} shows the traffic
generated by intensive editing sessions. Overall, the artificial authors insert
100 characters per second during 7 hours. The documents reach millions of
characters. Figure~\ref{fig:traffic} shows the combined effects of \SPRAY and
\LSEQ. Indeed, we observe that the traffic logarithmically scales to the editing
session size thanks to \SPRAY. But the messages transiting the network are
important too. The growth of each plot corresponds to the identifiers size
generated by \LSEQ. Since the document size grows, the identifiers grow, but
their growth slows over insertions.

We would like to perform a live demonstration of \CRATE that any
WWW2016 participant can join. We will start an "Exquisite
corpse''\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse}}
collaborative storytelling. In this game, every participant is invited
to continue or update the story initiated by previous participants.

To do so, we will bootstrap an initial document in the local browser
and share it through a public URL advertised on twitter. Every
participant can join the session by just clicking on the public link
with its own browser. Next, she can freely add a sentence. During
their editing session, we will invite participant to share and
advertise the document with their friends in order to get as many as
possible participants.

During the experiment, we are able to monitor the evolution of the
document and network. We expect the space complexity of the $id$
associated to each character to be upper-bound by $log(n)^2$ where $n$
is the total number of character. We expect the size of partial view
in browser to stay at $log(m)$ where $m$ is the number of real
participant at a given time.
 
% Figure~\ref{fig:live} depicts the demonstration setup. Figure~\ref{fig:liveA}
% shows the joining process where people would open a link in their web browser
% which would give them access to the editing session kept alive by \emph{Our
%   replica}. Once a participant joins the editing session, it becomes part of a
% network of browsers the goal of which is to create a document. Our replica,
% still connected to the editing session would save the replica regularly and make
% measurements about:
% \begin{asparadesc}
% \item [\textbf{the replicated structure size:}] depending on how the document is
%   edited, the underlying sequence structure can grow heavily or remain balanced.
%   While papers often assume right-to-left editing, human behavior is less
%   predictable. Yet, we suppose that participants structure the document by
%   themself and because of the given context. Such editing behavior would lead to
%   a balanced data structure remaining efficient over time. 
% \item [\textbf{the network:}] the traffic generated by the editing session, its
%   number of participants, the average neighborhood tables size, the message rate
%   over time.
% \end{asparadesc}

% About the web application itself, we would like to collect anonymous opinions
% about:
% \begin{asparadesc}
% \item [\textbf{Functionality:}] were there enough functionnalities to complete
%   your task?
% \item [\textbf{Reliability:}] were there any trouble with the editor or the
%   network?
% \item [\textbf{Efficiency:}] did you feel that operations were not responding on
%   time?
% \item [\textbf{Communication:}] were you aware of other participants' changes?
% \end{asparadesc}


%% We also would like to collect opinions on software aspects through an
%% anonymous survey. (\TODO{cf paper www2012}).

%% 1 strongly disagree -> 4 neither agree nor disagree -> 7 strongly agree

%% Functionality (suitability)
%% %% Overall, the editor supported me completing the task in a collaborative way
%% Reliablity (Maturity, recoverability)
%% %% Synchronization did not hinder my work
%% %% Page reload hinder work
%% %% on error, i recover easily
%% %% how satisfied about recover speed
%% Usability (Learnability Operability Satisfaction)
%% %% easy to learn
%% %% easy to use
%% %% actions of other did not hinder my work
%% %% overall enjoyable
%% Efficiency (Efficiency compliance)
%% %% Reponsiveness of local
%% %% Responsiveness on remote
%% %% synchronization appealing
%% Communication (Information Gathering)
%% %% presence of other participant
%% %% recognize changes on document

%% %% easily start editing at any time
%% %% edit as long as desired
%% %% editor preserved the changes i made
