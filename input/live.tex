\label{sec:live}

We would like to perform a live demonstration of \CRATE where we would allow
people to write a document together. A common goal would be assignated to them,
and possibly some sub-task would be randomly draw.

%% maybe a role playing game

%% write an introduction; write a chapter about a character; write about a city
%% make the link between two chapters; write about the end; write a plot twist
%% 

During the whole live experiment, we want to measure different aspect of the
aforementionned components. Measurements include:
\begin{itemize}
\item structure size over time
\item number of users
\item traffic 
\end{itemize}

We also would like to collect opinions on software aspects through an anonymous
survey. (\TODO{cf paper www2012}).
%% Functionality (suitability)
%% %% Overall, the editor supported me completing the task in a collaborative way
%% Reliablity (Maturity, recoverability)
%% %% Synchronization did not hinder my work
%% %% Page reload hinder work
%% %% on error, i recover easily
%% %% how satisfied about recover speed
%% Usability (Learnability Operability Satisfaction)
%% %% easy to learn
%% %% easy to use
%% %% actions of other did not hinder my work
%% %% overall enjoyable
%% Efficiency (Efficiency compliance)
%% %% Reponsiveness of local
%% %% Responsiveness on remote
%% %% synchronization appealing
%% Communication (Information Gathering)
%% %% presence of other participant
%% %% recognize changes on document
%% %% action of other participant
%% %% appealing editor highlighting actions
%% Coordination (Shared Access)
%% %% easily start editing at any time
%% %% edit as long as desired
%% %% editor preserved the changes i made
%% %% easily start any tool any time
%% %% '' ''  use any tool as long as desired
%% %% appealing collbarative editing

\TODO{What do we do with data afterwards.}
