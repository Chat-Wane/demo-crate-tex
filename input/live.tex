\label{sec:live}

We would like to perform a live demonstration of \CRATE where we would allow
WWW2016 participants to write a document together. A common goal would be
assignated to them, and possibly some sub-task would be randomly picked.

%% maybe a role playing game

%% write an introduction; write a chapter about a character; write about a city
%% make the link between two chapters; write about the end; write a plot twist
%%

  \subfloat[Figure A][\label{fig:liveA} Setup of the live
  experiment. People start joining through a mediator server connected to our
  replica. It incrementally builds an editing session with browsers
  (cf. figure~\ref{fig:liveB}).]{\input{input/livefigureA.tex}}

Figure~\ref{fig:live} depicts the demonstration setup. Figure~\ref{fig:liveA}
shows the joining process where people would open a link in their web browser
which would give them access to the editing session kept alive by \emph{Our
  replica}. Once a participant joins the editing session, it becomes part of a
network of browsers the goal of which is to create a document. Our replica,
still connected to the editing session would save the replica regularly and make
measurements about:
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [\textbf{the replicated structure size:}] depending on how the document is
  edited, the underlying sequence structure can grow heavily or remain balanced.
  \TODO{While papers often assume right-to-left editing}, human behavior is less
  predictable. Yet, we suppose that participants structure the document by
  themself and because of the given context. Such editing behavior would lead to
  a balanced data structure remaining efficient over time. 
\item [\textbf{the network:}] the traffic generated by the editing session, its
  number of participants, the average neighborhood tables size, the message rate
  over time.
\end{asparadesc}





About the web application itself, we would like to collect anonymous opinions
about:
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [\textbf{Functionality:}] were there enough functionnalities to complete
  your task?
\item [\textbf{Reliability:}] were there any trouble with the editor or the
  network?
\item [\textbf{Efficiency:}] did you feel that operations were not responding on
  time?
\item [\textbf{Communication:}] were you aware of other participants' changes?
\end{asparadesc}


%% We also would like to collect opinions on software aspects through an
%% anonymous survey. (\TODO{cf paper www2012}).

%% 1 strongly disagree -> 4 neither agree nor disagree -> 7 strongly agree

%% Functionality (suitability)
%% %% Overall, the editor supported me completing the task in a collaborative way
%% Reliablity (Maturity, recoverability)
%% %% Synchronization did not hinder my work
%% %% Page reload hinder work
%% %% on error, i recover easily
%% %% how satisfied about recover speed
%% Usability (Learnability Operability Satisfaction)
%% %% easy to learn
%% %% easy to use
%% %% actions of other did not hinder my work
%% %% overall enjoyable
%% Efficiency (Efficiency compliance)
%% %% Reponsiveness of local
%% %% Responsiveness on remote
%% %% synchronization appealing
%% Communication (Information Gathering)
%% %% presence of other participant
%% %% recognize changes on document
%% %% action of other participant
%% %% appealing editor highlighting actions
%% Coordination (Shared Access)
%% %% easily start editing at any time
%% %% edit as long as desired
%% %% editor preserved the changes i made
%% %% easily start any tool any time
%% %% '' ''  use any tool as long as desired
%% %% appealing collbarative editing

%% \TODO{What do we do with data afterwards.}
