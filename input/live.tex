\section{Live Experiment Setup}
\label{sec:live}

We would like to perform a live demonstration of \CRATE where we would allow
people to write a document together. A common goal would be assignated to them,
and possibly some sub-task would be randomly draw.

During the whole live experiment, we want to measure different aspect of the
aforementionned components. Measurements include:
\begin{itemize}
\item structure size over time
\item number of users
\item traffic 
\end{itemize}

We also would like to collect opinions on software aspects through an anonymous
survey. (\TODO{cf paper www2012}).

\TODO{What do we do with data afterwards.}
